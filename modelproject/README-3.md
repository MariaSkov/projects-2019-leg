!!Note: Paste pip install git+https://github.com/elben10/pydst in the Terminal before you run the code, in order to have pydst Package.

!!Note: Sometimes you might see the error message " the slider is not defined." in some graphs. If this happens, please patiently run the library kernal again and wait for several seconds, and then get back to the graph kernel. Usually this solves the problem. :)

Our project tries to study a theory about demographic economics that explains how income of a household and children mortality affect the decision of having children. In the model we maximize a utility function related to a budget constraint. 

The basic assumption of the primary model is that the only cost of having children is the reduction of working hours due to the time you have to spend in raising the children. In the extension of our model we will take into consideration the consumption of children.

As introduced, through our project we try to find the optimal number of children per household by combining utility function and budget constraint. In order to do so, we firstly study and visualize the utility function. Secondly, we find the general expression of the optimal number of children. Then we set up parameters to get the numerical result and compare it with the result obtain from the general expression. Finally, we work on the extension.

According to the results obtained in the project, the optimal number of children of the household is independent to the household income and mortality index, within the primary model. For the extension model we observe that income level and mortality index affect the decision on fertility.
