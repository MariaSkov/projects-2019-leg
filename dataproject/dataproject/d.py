## maybe we can work with the codes from "Fun application" lecture note: CO2 emmisions and GDP part
## I will write sth down on the jubyternote file(ipynb) in dataproject folder, right below the dataproject.ipynb file: this is the folder where we should write down the final code as a result. I will name my practice ipynb file as pr:dataprojet.ipynb. Plz add up or change stuffs freely there
